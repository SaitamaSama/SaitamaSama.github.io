So I started this blog a few minutes earlier... and I am still trying to figure out things!

So... first let's introduce myself...

My name is `Gourab Nag`, of 9th grade, currently struggling to implement the freakin' websocket protocol... I know I can be dumb sometimes, but no matter what, I cannot bring myself to understand those `frames`...

Anyways, I'm from Mars, and always look for interesting projects in PHP. Oh and by the way I love watching animes. Trust me they are good, very good. 

I am usually hanging around in [Room 11](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php). A lot of great people are in there.

And if you want a nice anime suggestions, here are some: (they are not ordered as per any ranking, I personally feel they all were good)

* Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
* Avatar: The Last Air-Bender (Tho not a anime, it's a must watch)
* Steins; Gate
* Clannad (Se I & II)
* Shigatsu wa Kimi No Uso
* Plastic Memories
* Tokyo Ghoul

I am currently working on [Leloutama](https://github.com/gourabNagDev/Leloutama). It's a multi-threaded web-server built upon PHP. And has the following features:

* Supports HTTP Caching.
* Supports response compression using `deflate` and `gzip`.
* Supports middleware in the form of extensions.
* Supports dynamic URL (thanks to FastRoute).
* Supports GET, HEAD, and POST.
* No need to download additional servers, just PHP.
* etc...
